# 🐍 Snake Game in Java  

This is my first Java project! 🎉 I built a simple Snake Game using Java and Swing. The game includes basic mechanics like movement, food collection, and collision detection.  

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use the **arrow keys** to move the snake.  
- Eat the **red food** to grow.  
- Avoid colliding with yourself or the walls—hitting them ends the game!

✔️ Simple and clean UI
