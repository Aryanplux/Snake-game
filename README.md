#🐍 Snake Game in Java
This is my first Java project! 🎉 I built a simple Snake Game using Java and Swing. The game includes basic mechanics like movement, food collection, and collision detection.

##🎮 How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
Eat the red food to grow.
Avoid colliding with yourself or the walls—hitting them ends the game!
🛠 Features
✔️ Grid-based movement
✔️ Randomized food placement
✔️ Collision detection
✔️ Simple and clean UI
